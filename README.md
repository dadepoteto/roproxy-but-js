# roproxy-but-js
uhhh roproxy but made by me in js idk if it will work um deploy dis on railway cuz its where its needed
also uh, you need an alt account with a .ROBLOSECURITY token for it to work (because roblox now limits tokenless presence info) uh u can either drop dis on railway or other sites like it :D

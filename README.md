# roproxy-but-js

uhhh it's roproxy... **but in JS**  
i made this cuz the real roproxy is dead, and roproxy-lite is kinda trash if you're doing POSTs like /presence or /auth.

this one actually supports:
- .ROBLOSECURITY cookies (via Railway env vars)
- CSRF token handling
- presence/game info so you can stalk your favorite streamer or whatever

## how to use
1. deploy this on Railway (or any node hosting site)
2. set your `.ROBLOSECURITY` token as an env var
3. done lol

> make sure your alt account:
> - has "who can join me" set to "everyone"
> - has a verified email/phone (optional but smart)
> - is NOT your main (seriously.)

## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ BIG FAT WARNING ⚠️⚠️⚠️

i am **NOT** responsible for you getting banned 💀  
if you do something dumb like use your main account or spam this too hard, that's on **you**.

**use an alt. always.**  
this proxy just forwards roblox api requests.  
what you do with it is **your problem**, not mine.
